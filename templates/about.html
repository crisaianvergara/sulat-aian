                    <p class="text-dark-emphasis">I wanted to learn how to code because I love the idea that technology can solve social problems. I also wanted to have the skills to be able to create any app or website imaginable! I came to this career path in a non-traditional way, as I studied the humanities in college. I completed a PhD in history and actually thought I was going to be a history professor! My dissertation explored the impacts of US militarism on women in the Philippines. If you're interested, feel free to check out my article on the topic.

                    While I really enjoyed academic research, I also felt like something was missing for me. Much of the work I was doing felt abstract, and it would take many years to see results (historians often spend decades working on a project before it gets published). This is what eventually led me to pursue UX design at first, which then propelled me into the world of web development.

                    <p class="text-dark-emphasis">
                    I don't see myself as starting over in my career, but rather building on my previous work with a more technical skill set. In my academic projects, I wanted to make a positive impact through research. I hope to do the same through creating apps and websites that focus on addressing user needs and solving problems.
